## Introduction
[Redis](https://redis.io) (REmote DIctionary Server) is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It can store and manipulate high-level data types like lists, maps, sets, and sorted sets. Because Redis can accept keys in a wide range of formats, operations can be executed on the server and reduce the client's workload. Also it holds its database entirely in memory, using the disk only for persistence. Redis is so popular being highly used by tech giants like GitHub, Pinterest, Snapchat, Twitter, StackOverflow, Flickr and many more.

**Why use Redis?**
- It is incredibly fast (written in ANSI C and runs on POSIX systems such as Linux, Mac OS X and Solaris).
- Often ranked the most popular key-value database and the most popular NoSQL database in containers.
- Helps you save cloud database calls using caching solution.
- It can be accessed by applications through its client API library.
- Supported in most of the languages like JavaScript, Java, Go, C, C++, C#, Python, Objective-C, PHP.
- It is open source and stable

**Real examples of use cases**
- some Facebook online games have a very high number of score updates, these operations are trivial using a Redis sorted set, even if there are millions of users and millions of new scores per minute.
- Twitter stores the timeline for all users with a Redis cluster
- Pinterest stores the user follower graphs in a Redis cluster where data is sharded across hundreds of instances
- Github, uses the queueing solution from Redis

## About Redis Cluster
[Redis Cluster](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial) is a set of Redis instances, designed for scaling a database by partitioning it, hence making it more resilient. Each member in the cluster, whether a primary or a secondary replica, manages a subset of the hash slot. If a master becomes unreachable then its slave will be promoted to master. In a minimal Redis Cluster made up of 3 master nodes each wigh a single slave node (to allow minimal fail-over), each master node is assigned a hash slot range between 0 and 16,383. Node A will contain hash slots from 0 to 5000, node B from 5001 to 10000, node C from 10001 to 16383. Communication inside the cluster is made via an internal bus, using a gossip protocol in order to propagate information about the cluster or to discover new nodes.

## Deploying Redis Cluster in Kubernetes

Getting Redis Cluster to work in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) has its challenges as each Redis instance relies on a configuration file that keeps track of other cluster instances and their roles. For this we need a combination of Kubernetesâ€™ [StatefulSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) and [PersistentVolumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/).

### Prerequisites
To perform this demo you will need the following:
- a Google Cloud Platform account, the free tier provided is more than enough (any other cloud should work the same)
- [Rancher](https://rancher.com)
- Kubernetes cluster running on Google Kubernetes Engine (running EKS or AKS should be the same)

### Starting a Rancher 2.0 instance
To begin, start a Rancher 2.0 instance. There is a very intuitive getting started guide for this purpose [here](https://rancher.com/quick-start/).

### Using Rancher to deploy a GKE cluster
Use Rancher to set up and configure your Kubernetes cluster, follow the how-to [guide](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-provisioning/hosted-kubernetes-clusters/gke/).

We will need a VM (can be the same with the one hosting our Rancher instance) with `Google Cloud SDK` and `kubelet` installed. Make sure that gcloud has access to the Cloud Platform with Google user credentials (`gcloud init` and `gcloud auth login`).
As soon as cluster is deployed from Rancher UI, we can check basic kubectl commands.

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                                     STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
gke-c-8dcng-default-pool-08c0a15c-2gpw   Ready    <none>   1h    v1.11.2-gke.18
gke-c-8dcng-default-pool-08c0a15c-4q79   Ready    <none>   1h    v1.11.2-gke.18
gke-c-8dcng-default-pool-08c0a15c-g9zv   Ready    <none>   1h    v1.11.2-gke.18
```

Let's now deploy Redis Cluster, either using `kubectl` to apply the yaml files, or importing them in Rancher's UI.

redis-sts.yaml:
```yaml

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f redis-sts.yaml

Check that Redis nodes are up and running. You can check the same using Rancher.

```bash
$kubectl get pods

Now we need to form Redis Cluster. To do this, let's run the following command and type 'yes' to accept the configuration. We will see that first three nodes will be selected to be **master**, last three will be **slaves**.

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it redis-cluster-0 -- redis-cli --cluster create --cluster-replicas 1 $(kubectl get pods -l app=redis-cluster -o jsonpath='{range.items[*]}{.status.podIP}:6379 ')

## Testing Redis cluster

Now that we have Redis cluster up and running let's test it. For this we will use a simple Restul API written in Python and using Redis. Its only purpose is to count the number of hits a webpage has received.

**Optional:** script can be modified hence the image will need to be rebuilt, otherwise we can skip the above steps.

```

As soon as hit-counter-lb Service is up and we have a public IP address assigned we can start hitting it. The request is going to call our python script and this, using a library, will connect to Redis and increase a key called `hits` and then return it as response.

Now, as we saw the Redis key increasing with every hit, let's try bring one of the master nodes down. We will see how `redis-cluster-0` previously as master, will turn into slave, and its slave, `redis-cluster-3` will become master. Now try to hit again the public IP, you will see that the number of hits is kept and data was not lost.

**Before:**
```bash
$ kubectl describe pods redis-cluster-0 | grep IP
IP:                 10.28.0.5
      POD_IP:   (v1:status.podIP)

$ kubectl describe pods redis-cluster-3 | grep IP
IP:                 10.28.0.6
      POD_IP:   (v1:status.podIP)

$ kubectl exec -it redis-cluster-0 -- redis-cli role
1) "master"
2) (integer) 1859
3) 1) 1) "10.28.0.6"
      2) "6379"
      3) "1859"

$ kubectl exec -it redis-cluster-3 -- redis-cli role
1) "slave"
2) "10.28.0.5"
3) (integer) 6379
4) "connected"
5) (integer) 1859
```
Bringing down a node and checking to see how roles have changed for the two master-slave pair.


**After:**
```bash
$ kubectl exec -it redis-cluster-0 -- redis-cli role
1) "slave"
2) "10.28.0.6"
3) (integer) 6379
4) "connected"
5) (integer) 2111

$ kubectl exec -it redis-cluster-3 -- redis-cli role
1) "master"
2) (integer) 2111
3) 1) 1) "10.28.2.12"
      2) "6379"
      3) "2111"
```

You can see here, in the last command, the IP for `redis-cluster-0` node has changed. Previously was `10.28.0.5`, now it is `10.28.2.12`. If you remember few lines above, we were saying that Redis relies on a configuration file that keeps track of other cluster instances and their roles. So, how did the cluster remain up and running since the role and the IP changed? Simple, in our `configMap` we have a script that automatically replaces the old IP for the node with its new one, this way our cluster is not impacted for any node failure.
So, we can check the public IP for our python app, hit it few times and can see the counter didn't reset but resumed from previously stored value.

## Conclusion

Redis is such a powerfull tool and Redis cluster, which is a distributed implementation of the first adds some extra goals to this already great product. We have now higher performance, linear scalability and better availability due to this cluster architecture. Our data is automatically split among multiple nodes and we have now the ability to continue operations when a subset of the nodes are experiencing failures or are unable to communicate with the rest of the cluster.
We saw how to deploy Redis Cluster on Kubernetes with the help of [Rancher](https://rancher.com), also we tested a basic scenario to see that we have a working environment.
If you need more information on Redis Cluster, don't hesitate check the great official documentation available [here](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial) or [here](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec).
